## I'm writing a "Now" page because it makes sense. I like to do things differently. When most people zig, I want to zag.

## The "Now" page is incredibly useful. It's not being different, just for different's sake.

## It is interesting to know what people are up to. When I meet new people one of my favorite questions is "What fun projects are you working on now?"

## If you asked me that question. This is how I would answer.


## What I'm working on right now:
---

- [14" MacBook Pro, Liquid Retina XDR display, M3, 16GB of RAM](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro "Macbook Pro")
    Prior to this I was using a 2015 5K iMac as my main machine and a 2014 13" MacBook Pro for travel. This machine is more powerful than my iMac and feels just as portable as my 13" did â€” really love this computer.

## Who I'm seeking:
---


## What I'm currently learning:
---

## Other things I'm up to...
