## I'm writing a "Now" page because it makes sense. I like to do things differently. When most people zig, I want to zag.

## The "Now" page is incredibly useful. It's not being different, just for different's sake.

## It is interesting to know what people are up to. When I meet new people one of my favorite questions is "What fun projects are you working on now?"

## If you asked me that question. This is how I would answer in no particular order.


### What I'm working on right now:
- Being the best husband and learning from, playing with, and taking care of my 8 month old daughter
- Writing and coding everyday, by pushing a daily commit
- I have been mentoring individuals on Salesforce, off and on for a few years now and find it incredibly rewarding
- Developing better daily habits: sleep 8 hours, floss, meditate, stretch, exercise and cook healthy food


### Who I'm seeking:
- Experienced developers, designers and creatives who are curious about entrepreneurship and learning
- Young Salesforce Professionals who are looking for mentorship and guidance


### What I'm currently learning:
- Practicing my latte art and espresso pulls with my home machine, intending to reach barista level art and espresso (focusing on form first and than speed)



### Other things I'm up to...
- Reading a new book roughly once a month and most recently it is 
- Meeting new people. My goal is to talk to someone new everyday. It's hard but that is why I love it. I fail most days but I keep at it
- Listening to lots of podcasts and audiobooks
- Wandering around Detroit, MI

I'm learning everyday and embracing the challenges and opportunities that come my way. I'm grateful for the journey and excited about what the future holds.


Here is what I Was doing (a log of all my updates to the Now page)
