description: "I like to keep track of where I’ve been just as much as where I’m headed. That’s why I created a “Was” page: it’s a snapshot of the projects, goals, and milestones that used to fill my schedule before my current “Now.” It’s a chance to look back, see how far I’ve come, and appreciate the twists and turns along the way. If you’re curious about my past pursuits—or just looking for a little inspiration—this page is for you."
