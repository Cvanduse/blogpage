I get a lot of questions about the tools I use for different parts of my work, so inspired by a few friends, I've put together this "uses" page that covers every part of my setup.

A few of the links below are affiliate links which means I get paid or rewarded in some way if you use them to purchase, but rest assured these are all tools and services I actually use and would highly recommend.

## Workstation:
---

- [14" MacBook Pro, Liquid Retina XDR display, M3, 16GB of RAM](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro "Macbook Pro")
    Prior to this I was using a 2015 5K iMac as my main machine and a 2014 13" MacBook Pro for travel. This machine is more powerful than my iMac and feels just as portable as my 13" did â€” really love this computer.

- [Apple iPad Pro M3](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro "iPad Pro")

  A must have for any professional. I use this for a combination of work and personal. For work, I use this as a extension of my desktop setup with sidecar.

- [Keychron K2 Mechanical Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Keychron-Bluetooth-Wireless-Mechanical-Tenkeyless-Keyboard/dp/B07QBPDWLS/ref=asc_df_B07QBPDWLS/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=693127817018&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12457270139867431986&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9016839&hvtargid=pla-837935119151&mcid=179b6fe1c37b36dd861849b22ad92258&th=1 "Keychron")

    I can't stand the arrow keys on the keyboards Apple makes today so I use this keyboard instead. 

- [Magic Mouse](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK2E3AM/A/magic-mouse-white-multi-touch-surface "Magic Mouse")

    Used to think I preferred the trackpad after being a laptop-only user for so long, but I love the extra precision you get with a real mouse, especially for video and audio editing.

- [Magic Trackpad](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK2D3AM/A/magic-trackpad-white-multi-touch-surface "Magic Trackpad")
  
  I keep this on the left hand side of my keyboard but it doesn't see much use. Usually just to scroll Twitter if my right hand is busy holding a drink.

- [Razer Kiyo Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kiyo-Streaming-Webcam-High-Performance/dp/B08T1MWX6J?th=1 "Razer Kiyo Pro")

    Although the Kiyo Pro is not higly compatiable with Macs. It does a great job correcting lighting and is crisp and clear. 


- [Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Mini-customizable/dp/B07DYRS1WH/ref=asc_df_B07DYRS1WH/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=692875362841&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=126364436150393871&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9016839&hvtargid=pla-2281435179258&mcid=3633ba9afcfc334da7d56ae9db050ed2&hvocijid=126364436150393871-B07DYRS1WH-&hvexpln=73&th=1 "Stream Deck")
  
  I did not know a device with 6 buttons could make so much of a difference for my productivity. The stream deck is customized to meet anyways needs.


- [VIVO Electric sit/stand desk](https://www.amazon.com/VIVO-Adjustable-Workstation-Controller-DESK-KIT-1B6B/dp/B07V6ZSHF4/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.hZzSm7sxo2tK90D22tfcMYpbLy-2AhWkdCSuIzGKiH_Efntpb9XALm8Vt0a3p2zRBxM5Oh85wmc33ZtvfzkUvriJ_kS7gSkUvIj5RYdsqAE8Ytj_fvUVzcxpC_Z5t12yKJ4IEZ6rGXqtwMyMOlx3MrXjy6av5rqIfWVFZoB-tihqija0SKOVpQ7UgPF0rCnvXSvAVSbz0B0myqXDLu7snxZIlUTgKjYOYYfp8Rb4L_ldQSTG49hb2ubRUMrnuR9CotCh9gZqra_1n3I8ejVYJ_ZpZRMSLrMOQsEVPtxSuQ4.XHuJKNxDlIqmvLoWluInEJgHIsQng5FVCnzEt-gLuuI&dib_tag=se&hvadid=557253848601&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9016839&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=17555440866997334537&hvtargid=kwd-835641237987&hydadcr=15456_13495270&keywords=amazon+vivo+standing+desk&qid=1726767166&sr=8-2-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1 "Standing Desk")
  
  This desk has great reviews and would agree with it. It's quite big, really deep, and super stable. I stand probably 50% of the time and find the presets to be a game changer.

- [Gaiam Balance Ball Chair](https://www.amazon.com/Gaiam-Classic-Balance-Ball-Chair/dp/B0007VB4NE/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=1F7O6IDEJTLHY&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Mxvc8PAaDMjMV7Y0M77zRLPUJKgzSnH9TkpjwrQOfSgltndHeeBMgTwv7UVdx2QbYt99DCQFeRMrRabQYdm-mXeYOlGm6j38rDqRYQ9E3fAtV1S-Vr8gyz60OZ93-Kwrwud9kpZbseT0LDcCpwP_DAEsulZ1MaEV9aSVbeF_xs_4U-bzaeM-_26d5TnWlW9RGz0VcaD685cCp4_Vorx_oQ_0XPB3CLwYg-OOivIdfPd0iCPt67H3SQmUy7_WbNtoCIO0rauvxFzh7-D4R_4L1c5Q2dgU4Zb39cxgTCi99kI.W7-9bi_szt-pTdHqyKWTYuyvapo1xPwEeWQy1yg9-ps&dib_tag=se&keywords=exercise%2Bball%2Bchair&qid=1726767333&sprefix=exercise%2Bball%2Bchair%2Caps%2C121&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1 "Exercise Ball Chair")
  
  It may not be a Herman Miller Aeron but I find it to be really comfortable for long periods of times. Plus it forces me to stand more often which is always a plus.

## Development:


- [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/ "Sublime")
  
  Still the most productive text editing environment I've ever used. Any time I try something else, within minutes I run into dozens of things it's missing or that Sublime does better.

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "VS Code")

  It's not as good as Sublime at editing text but trying to give it an honest go these days because the community is so big and development is really active. Favorite feature it has over Sublime is the integrated terminal.

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/ "Chrome")

  I'd like to give Firefox another shot one day but for now still using Chrome for both development and general browsing.

- [Github](https://github.com/ "Github")

## Design:


- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/ "Figma")
  
  Figma is like Sketch but a million times more performant and cross-platform. It's the most impressive web app I've ever used.


---
## Productivity:


- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/ "Alfred")
  
  I forgot to add this originally because it's so baked into my workflow that I forgot it was even there. I use it to launch apps, for clipboard management, for customer support snippets, and probably tons more I'm still forgetting.

- [Asana](https://asana.com/ "Asana")
  
  I use Asana to keep track of all my projects and workflows. Great UX/UI and constantly seeing improvements to functionality and design.

- [Todoist](https://todoist.com/ "Todoist")
  
  I use Todoist to keep track of my todos. I really like the scheduled and recurring tasks features, lets me use Todoist for a lot of stuff that you might normally put in a calendar.

- [Calendly](https://calendly.com/ "Calendly")
  
  I use Calendly to schedule  interviews and other meetings. So much nicer than trying to work out a time to chat by going back and forth in an email thread.

- [1Password](https://1password.com/ "1Password")
 
  Such a great password manager, installing this for the first time was life-changing.


- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/ "Dropbox")
 
  I keep all my important files in Dropbox so they are available on both my machines. I don't use anything else for backups because literally nothing that isn't in Dropbox is important.

---
## Hosting:


- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/ "Netlify")
  
  For my static sites (like this one), I use Netlify. It is probably my favorite app that I interact with on a regular basis. The UI is beautiful, the experience is awesome, and the app is insanely fast. I get excited every time I have an excuse to use it for something new.
