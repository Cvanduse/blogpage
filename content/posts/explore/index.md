description: "There’s nothing I love more than hitting the road or hopping on a train to explore new places. Whether it’s cruising through the U.S. by train or driving from the Amalfi Coast to Venice in Italy, the journey itself is always half the fun. For me, it’s all about soaking in the views, discovering hidden gems, and making every trip an adventure to remember."

Traveling and exploring are two very important things for me. In 2010, I spent 3 days on a train traveling across the country with my family. 

In 2020, we did an international trup to italy where I drove from the almafi coast all the way to venice. It is also the place where I proposed to my wife.
